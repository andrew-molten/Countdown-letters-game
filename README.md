# Countdown Letters game

Games are 4 rounds long,

You have to try an make the longest english word out of the 9 letters you pick, each time choosing a random Consonant or Vowel,

Choose wisely,

Once you have 9 letters, 30 seconds is on the clock, you must submit your answer before the clock hits 0 or you won't get any points.

To receive points, your word must be in the webster dictionary,

You face the impossible task of versing the dictionary, at best you can be tied for a win!

But I've also added a high score, so on your next game you can play against yourself,

Good Luck!
